*Image:* The Arithmetic 1492-94 Fresco Palazzi Pontifici, Vatican
Borgia Apartment (Wikipedia).

*Sources:* Some material for this lesson comes from [[davies][Davies (2016)]] and
[[matloff][Matloff (2020)]]. These and other sources have been important to me in
preparing this course and getting into R int he first place. Check
them out for a more systematic treatment of R. There is also a more
philosophical, personal view on my use of sources [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds101/wiki/Why-R,-my-path,-DataCamp][in the Wiki]] for the
2020 version of this course.

*What is this?* When we say "Arithmetic", we don't mean that we "study"
numbers but that we use them to perform computations. After this
section, you'll be able to perform any arithmetic operation using R.

We will look at /operators/ first, then at simple but important
functions that occur again and again, especially in /statistics/.

*How can you learn better?* This presentation consists mostly of text
and code chunks. Because this is dry stuff, I urge you (both if you
hear this in class, and if you work through this on your own) to open
an R session on the side and type along - this will build muscle
memory and keep you entertained, too! Another trick, which you will
find in [[matloff][Matloff's excellent beginner's tutorial]], is to make your own
little exercises by varying the instructions. A third way is to go
through the lecture and create your own Emacs Org-mode notebook with R
code blocks.

*Operator order:*

1) *P* arentheses: ~()~
2) *E* xponentiation: ~^~ or ~**~
3) *M* ultiplication: ~*~
4) *D* ivision: ~/~
5) *A* ddition: ~+~
6) *S* ubtraction: ~-~

/Tip: You can check identity in R with the ~identical~ function./

#+begin_notes
In R, standard mathematical rules apply. The order of operators is as
usual - left to right, parentheses, exponents, multiplication,
division, addition, subtraction (PEMDAS = Please Excuse My Dear Aunt
Sally) mnemonic).

The operators ~^~ and ~**~ for exponentiation are identical, though ~^~ is
more common. You can check that in the R console with the ~identical~
function - the result should be ~TRUE~ (this is a truth or Boolean
value - more on this below) - see figure:

* Practice: Formula Translator
#+attr_html: :width 500px

- For the practice exercises, create a new Org-mode file.

- Make sure your file contains this in the top line:
  #+begin_example
  #+PROPERTY: header-args:R :session *R* :results output
  #+end_example

- If you enter this line for the first time, run it with =C-c C-c=.

** Formula translator I

- What is the result of this expression?
  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  [[../img/4_challenge1.png]]

- Why?
  #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
    2**3 * ((6/3 * 5)) + (24 - 9)
  #+end_src

- Why? Remember the PEMDAS order:
  #+begin_example
  2**3 = 2^3 = 8
  6/3 = 2
  2 * 5 * 8 = 80
  24 + 80 = 104
  104 - 9 = 95
  #+end_example

- Instead of ~^~ you can use ~**~

- R code:
  #+name: formula
  #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
    24 + 6/3 * 5 * 2**3 - 9  # as written
    2**3 * ((6/3 * 5)) + (24 - 9)  # as computed
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: formula
  : [1] 95
  : [1] 95

** Formula translator II

[[../img/4_challenge2.png]]

- Compute the expressions (2)-(5)

- You need parentheses in the exponent

- Note: ~-2~ is interpreted as ~-1 * 2~

- Use your Org-mode file so that you can fix errors more easily!

** Solution II

[[../img/4_fig_formula.png]]

- You need parentheses in the exponent
- ~-2~ is interpreted as ~-1 * 2~

#+begin_notes
When you use R, you'll often have to translate a formula into
code. Consider the formulas above, hich seem pretty complicated: the
only trick here is that you often need to use parentheses, e.g. around
calculations in the exponent, or when calculating with negative
numbers in eq. (4), because the number ~-2~ e.g. is interpreted by R as
the operation ~-1 * 2~.
#+end_notes

** Formula Translator V

- What does ~(-1)^(1/2)~ return?
- Use a function to compute this last command
- Can you explain the result?

- Solution in R:
  #+begin_src R :results output
    (-1)^(1/2)
    sqrt(-1)
  #+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] NaN
: [1] NaN

#+begin_notes
Complex numbers? The "~NaN~" result, which is also "[[https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a31782879/square-root-negative-one-westworld/][The Math Problem
That Broke the Westworld Simulation]]" (the 2019 AI TV
mini-series). Basically, R will hand you a "Not A Number" whenever
you try to, e.g. take the square root of a negative number (try
~sqrt(-1)~ or ~(-1)^(1/2))~. We won't need complex numbers in this
course, but (of course) there are functions to handle them ([[https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/complex.html][see here]]
or run ~?complex~).

- ~?log10~ ( log_10)

- ~?exp~ (e)

- ~?pi~ (\pi)

*Do you know how to compute these without library functions?*[fn:1]

*Do you remember how these functions are defined?*[fn:2]

*Are logarithm, exponential function and \pi connected somehow?*[fn:3]

* Logarithmic transformation
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px

Some examples:
#+begin_example R
log10(1 * 10^7) = 7        log10(x) = log(x, b=10) = log(x,10)

log10(100) = 2 , log10(1000) = 3 , log10(1e3) = log10(1 * 10^3) = 3

log(1) = 0, log10(1) = 0

log(x=100,b=100) = 1 , log(4.583,4.583) = 1

log(x=100,b=10) = 2 , log(b=10,x=100) = 2
#+end_example

#+begin_notes
It is often necessary to transform numerical data, e.g. transforming
data using the logarithm leading e.g. from the left to the right graph
in the figure. As you can see, this transformation leads to a
*compression* of the ~y~-values, so that more of these values can be
shown. It's a semi-logarithmic transformation (only one axis).

The /logarithm/ of a number ~x~ is always computed using a /base/ ~b~. In
the diagram, ~b=10~, the numbers on the ~x~ axis were transformed
using the ~log()~ function, the logarithm with base ~10~. The logarithm
of ~x=100~ to the base ~10~ is ~2~, because 10^2 = 100. In R,
~log(x=100,b=10) = 2~ (try this yourself!).
#+end_notes

Let's make such a graph - it's not hard in R:
#+begin_src R :file exp.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
  x <- abs(rnorm(1000))
  y <- exp(x) # f(x)
  plot(x,y)
  title("Exponential function")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:exp.png]]

And now the logarithmic transformation:
#+begin_src R :file log.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
  plot(x,log10(y))
  title("Logarithmic transformation")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:log.png]]

But to see what's going on you need to see them next to one another:
#+begin_src R :file explog.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
  par(mfrow=c(1,2),pty='s')
  plot(x,y,main="Exponential function")
  plot(x,log10(y),main="Log transformation")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:explog.png]]

Notice that the logarithm of x values between 0 and 1 is negative, and
that I take the absolute value because the logarithm of negative
values is not defined and leads to =NaN=.
#+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
  r <- head(abs(rnorm(1000)))
  r
  log(r)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

* Logarithm rules

[[../img/4_rules.gif]]

- Argument ~x~ and base ~b~ must be positive
- For all x: log_x(x) = ~log(x, b=x) = 1~ since only x^1 = x
- For all b: log_b(1) = ~log(x=1, b) = 0~ since b^0 = 1

* Exponential function
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/4_euler.jpeg]]

- In R, ~log(x)~ implies ~b = e \approx 2.7182~

- In mathematics, the /Euler constant/ ~e~ is as magical as the other
  mysterious constants \pi, 0, 1 and i (the imaginary unit). There are
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)][different ways]] to arrive at its value of approximately
  2.718282.

- The Wikipedia entry on ~e~ contains some fun stuff for nerds
  ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)#In_computer_culture][here]]). Apparently, /Steve Wozniak/ computed ~e~ to 116,000 digits on
  an "ancient" Apple II computer in /1981/!

- For now, we only care about the fact that $e$ is the base of the
  natural logarithm, denoted as ~ln~ or log_e(x).

e^{ln^{x}} = ln(e^x) or exp(log(x)) = log(exp(x)) = x

1) Compute the log of 10,000,000 to base 10 in R
2) Enter ~log10(10,000,000)~ in R. What's going on?
3) Find the logarithm to base 10 for 10,000,010.
4) Why is the result the same as before?
5) Tip: enter ~log10(10000100)~

- Solution:
  #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
    log10(10000000) # 7 because 10,000,000 = 10^7
    log(10000000,10) # same thing

    log10(10000010) # still 7
    log10(10000100) # 7.000004  (six digits is default)

    options(digits=10)  # change digit formatting default
    log10(10000010) # 7.000000434
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1] 7
  : [1] 7
  : [1] 7.000000434
  : [1] 7.000004343
  : [1] 7.000000434

#+begin_notes
See figure below:
1) The error in the first line results from the fact that in R
   functions, the comma separates arguments, so it looks to R as if
   3 arguments were provided where only one is required, because,
   unlike the function ~log()~, ~log10()~ already has a fixed base
   ~b=10~. This is fixed in the next line.
2) The trouble with the seemingly identical results of
   ~log10(10000010)~ and ~log10(10000000)~ lies in the suppression of
   digits. This can be fixed with the ~options()~ utility function,
   which we met in an earlier lecture. After setting
   ~options(digits=10)~, the missing numbers appear.
3) Typing ~log10(10000100)~ would have revealed the problem, because
   this result can be shown with the default number of digits (~7~).

* Practice: =exp= vs. =log=

Verify this for ~x=10~, ~x=2.718282~, and ~x=0~ using R:

e^ln^(x) = ln(e^x) = x

1) Assign the three values to a vector =x=
2) Verify manually that =log= and =exp= are inverse to one another
3) Use =identical= and =all.equal= to verify the same thing

Solution:
#+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
  ## Store values in vector
  x <- c(10,exp(1),0)
  x

  ## Verify that log and exp are inverse to one another
  exp(log(x)) -> exp_log
  log(exp(x)) -> log_exp

  ## Use identical() and all.equal()
  identical(exp_log,log_exp)
  all.equal(exp_log,log_exp)

  print(exp_log)
  print(log_exp)

  options(digits=16)
  print(exp_log)
  print(log_exp)
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
To compare e.g. in selection statements (=if=), always use =identical=
#+end_quote
* Practice: mathematical constants

Think about the mathematical packages you have to load.

1) Enter =pi= (\pi \approx 3.14)
2) Enter =LETTERS= and =letters=
3) What data type are =LETTERS= and =letters=?
4) Print =month.name= and =month.abb=
5) Is =month.abb= a vector? Check it!
6) Print Euler's number =e= to precision 10

Solution:
#+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
  pi #1
  LETTERS #2
  letters
  class(LETTERS) #3
  class(letters)
  month.name #4
  month.abb

* E-notation
#+NAME: fig:powers

[[../img/4_powers-ten.png]]

#+begin_notes
You already know that the number of digits that is displayed by R can
be changed using the ~options()~ utility function. The default number of
digits displayed is 7.

In order to display values with many more digits than that - either
very large, or very small numbers, we use the scientific or
e-notation. In this notation, any number is expressed as a multiple
of 10.
#+end_notes

* E-xamples
#+attr_html: :width 600px:
[[../img/penguins2.jpg]]

- 10,0000 = ~10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10~ = 1 * 10^5 = ~1e+05~

- ~7.45678389e12~ = 7.45678389 * 10^12 = 745.678389 * 10^10

- ~exp(1)~ = e = ~271828182845e-11~ = 271828182845\times10^{-11}

* Practice: e-notation

Look at the ~help~ for the ~options~ function if necessary.

1) Show the current value of how many digits are displayed
2) Reset this value to 15 (you know two ways to do this)
3) Store 100,000,000 in an object ~foo~ and print it
4) Print ~foo~ using ~format~ and set the attribute ~scientific~ to ~FALSE~:
   ~format(foo, scientific=FALSE)~
5) Enter 0.000'000'000'000'000'10 (without the apostrophes)
6) Enter ~exp(1000)~
7) Enter ~(-1)/0~
8) Enter ~sqrt(-1)~

#+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both :noweb yes
  options()$digits
  options(digits=15)
  100000 -> foo
  foo
  format(foo,scientific=FALSE)
  as.integer(format(foo,scientific=FALSE)) # to compute with it
  0.00000000000000010
  exp(1000)
  (-1)/0
  sqrt(-1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

[1] "100000"
[1] 100000
[1] 1e-16
[1] Inf
[1] -Inf
[1] NaN
Warning message:
In sqrt(-1) : NaNs produced
#+end_example

#+begin_notes
To get from the e-notation with exponent y or -y to the complete
number of digits, simply move the decimal point by y places to the
right or to the left, resp.

No information is lost even if R hides digits; e-notation is purely
to improve readability. Extra bits are stored by R

~Inf~, ~-Inf~ and ~NaN~ are special numbers.

* Special numbers
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/4_special.jpg]]

- ~Inf~ for positive infinity (\infty)
- ~-Inf~ for negative infinity (-\infty)
- ~NaN~ for "Not-a-Number" (not displayable)
- ~NA~ for "Not Available" (missing value)

#+begin_notes
1) ~NA~ values are especially important when we clean data and must
   remove missing values. There are Boolean (logical) functions to
   test for special values.

2) Non-computable values can be created easily by doing "forbidden"
   stuff. An example is trying to compute the square root of a
   negative number, e.g. ~(-2)^(1/2)~. The result is a complex number
   (in this case the solution to the quadratic equation $x²+1=0$,
   called the imaginary number $i$). You can also use the function
   ~is.na~ to test for missing values: compute ~is.nan(sqrt(-1))~ for
   example.
#+end_notes

* Practice: special numbers

Execute the following expressions in an R code block - before running
it with ~C-c C-c~, think about the likely output!

1) ~Inf + 1~

4) ~Inf / Inf~
5) ~1/0~
6) ~-1/0~
7) ~NA~
8) ~NA + NA~

1) ~10^309~ is ~Inf~. The last number is infinite, because the largest
   number that can be represented by a 64-bit computer is

* Logical values and operators
#+attr_html: :width 300px
#+caption: George Boole
[[../img/4_boole.jpg]]

#+begin_notes
~TRUE~ and ~FALSE~ are reserved in R for logical values, and the variables
~T~ and ~F~ are already predefined. This can cause problems, because these
variable names are not reserved, i.e. you can redefine them. So better
stay away from saving time by using the short versions of these
values.
#+end_notes

* Practice: logical values

- Tasks:
  1) Print ~TRUE~
  2) Can you use ~true~ instead of ~TRUE~?
  4) Can you use ~T~ instead of ~TRUE~?
  5) Assign ~FALSE~ to an R object named ~T~
  6) Print ~T~
  7) What type of R object is ~TRUE~?

- Solution:
  #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
    TRUE
    T  # printing true generates an error
    T <- FALSE
    T
    class(TRUE)
  #+end_src

#+begin_notes
Richard Cotton (2011) calls R's logic "Troolean" logic, because
besides the so-called Boolean values ~TRUE~ and ~FALSE~, R also has a
third logical value, the "missing" value, ~NA~.
#+end_notes

* Logical operators

There are three logical operators in R:

~!~ for "/not/":  ~1 != 1~

~&~ for "/and/":  ~(1==1) & (1==2)~

~|~ for  "/or/": ~(1==2) ~| (1!=1)~

#+begin_notes

[[../img/4_logops.png]]

In the last command, we generated a ~FALSE~ value by comparing two
~FALSE~ values, which is the only way to make an ~|~ statement ~FALSE~.

#+end_notes

* Practice: logical operators

1) Check equality of ~sqrt(2)^2~ and ~2~ using a logical operator.
2) Check that "1 is equal 2 or 1 is not equal 1" is ~FALSE~.

Solution:
#+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
  sqrt(2)^2 == 2
  (1 == 2) | (1 != 1)
#+end_src

#+begin_notes
Comparing non-integers is iffy, because non-integers (floating-point
numbers) are only an approximation of the "pure", real numbers - how
accurate they are depends on the architecture of your computer. In
practice, this means that rounding errors can creep in your
calculations, leading to wildly wrong answers. [[https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Why-doesn_0027t-R-think-these-numbers-are-equal_003f][The R FAQ has an own
entry about it]]. The figure shows a simple example: ~sqrt(2)^2~ and ~2~
should be the same, but they aren't as far as R is concerned - a
logical comparison with ~==~ gives ~FALSE~. To test near equality (bar
rounding errors), you can use the function ~all.equal~. To test for
exact equality, use ~identical~:

[[../img/4_floating.png]]

*CHALLENGE:* (1) Check the help pages ~?all.equal~ and
~?identical~. (2) Which of these numbers are infinite? ~0~, ~Inf~,

- In R mathematical expressions are evaluated according to the
  /PEMDAS/ rule.

- The natural logarithm ln(x) is the inverse of the exponential
  function e^x.

- In the scientific or e-notation, numbers are expressed as positive
  or negative multiples of 10.

- Each positive or negative multiple shifts the digital point to the
  right or left, respectively.

- Infinity ~Inf~, not-a-number ~NaN~, and not available numbers ~NA~
  are /special values/ in R.

[fn:1]I've recently been reminded [[https://bigthink.com/13-8/math-thinking/][through this article]] how important
it may be to be able to do computations without the help of
machines. Here are [[https://gauravvjn.quora.com/4-ways-to-calculate-Square-Root-without-using-inbuilt-functions-in-C-language-Interview-Puzzle][4 ways]] to compute ~sqrt~ in C (though not very
fast). In general: 1) using logarithms and exponentials
(sqrt(x)=e^{0.5 \times ln(x)}), 2) using successive approximate
numerical methods like [[https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NewtonsIteration.html][Newton's iteration]], 3) using modified long
division ([[https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-a-Square-Root-by-Hand#Finding_Square_Roots_Manually_sub][prime factorization]]), 4) [[https://www.mathworks.com/help/fixedpoint/ug/implement-fixed-point-square-root-using-lookup-table.html][looking it up in a table]] (source:
[[https://www.quora.com/How-do-computers-calculate-square-roots][quora.com]])

[fn:2] The square root of x is the number that returns x when the
square root is squared: For example, sqrt(4) = sqrt(2^2) = 2. The
logarithm of x to the base b is the power of b that returns x:
log_10(100) = log_10(10^2) = 2, and log_2(4) = log_2(2^2) = 2. The
exponential (power) function is the inverse of the logarithm:
log_10(10^1) = 1 (b=10), log(e)=log_e(e)=log_e(e^1)=1 (b=e), and log_2(2^1)=1
(b=2).

[fn:3]Logarithm and exponential are the inverse of one another, and
the exponential function e and \pi are connected via this beautiful,
mysterious formula by Euler: e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 or more general e^ix =
cos(x) + sin(x), where i is the imaginary unit, i^2 = -1. Used in
physics and engineering for example to analyse oscillatory systems.
