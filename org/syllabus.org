* Objectives

Data science is concerned with getting data to work for us, to give us
its (presumed) hidden treasures. Data science has been called "the
sexiest job of the 21st century". Even if you don't want to become a
professonial data scientist, it's helpful to master the basic concepts
if you want to succeed in today's data-driven business.

* Target audience

The course is for anyone who is interested in becoming more data
literate in their own field of interest - be it languages, theatre,
biology, psychology or exercise science - and growing their personal
skill stack. Visualization of data-driven insights and improved
productivity when working with data and media is a concern for any
professional.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete "Introduction to data science" (DSC 105) will be
able to:

- Learn computer and data science principles by playing with data
- Acquire basic programming skills using Python, R, SQL, and bash
- Apply literate programming principles by working with Org-mode
- Use infrastructure including command line, Jupyter notebooks, GitHub
- Understand the relationship of humans, machines, and data
- Develop their critical thinking skills
- Learn how to effectively use AI coding assistants like Copilot, Code
  Interpreter (ChatGPT)
- Understand the impact of, and can code in R, Python, SQL, bash
- Know how to effectively present assignment and project results

Students, who complete DSC 105 will have fulfilled the prerequisites
for DSC 205, Introduction to advanced data science, which focuses on
advanced practices in data exploration, visualization, and integration
with databases and other languages through R and Python packages and
APIs.

* Course requirements

Formal prerequisites: Introduction to Programming (either CSC100 or
CSC115 or CSC109, and MTH101 (College Algebra).

Otherwise no prior knowledge required. Some knowledge of, and
experience with computers and/or programming is useful but not
critical. Curiosity is essential. You will gain data literacy skills
by taking this course. The course will prepare you for further studies
in computer and data science, or in other disciplines that use modern
computing, i.e. every discipline, from accounting to zoology).

* A note on using AI to write code for you or debug your code

[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/fall24/UsingAItoCode.pdf][See full PDF on GitHub.]]

*Short summary:* For students, using AI is a waste of time at best, and
a crime against your ability to learn at worst. Learning never comes
without pain and (temporary) desperation. AI is like a pill but one
that only works some of the time, and you'll never know when. Instead:
join Lyon's Programming Student Club and experience the pain of not
knowing first hand every week!

Will you be punished for using AI in my class?*

Not directly because nobody can tell if you used AI or not but
indirectly by turning in suboptimal results, by learning less, and
by having less time for other, more productive activities.


*Are there any data on this?*

Not much on coding as such but a recent (15 July), substantive, long
(59 p) paper titled "Generative AI Can Harm Learning"), based on a
very carefully conducted field experiment with a large (1000) sample
of high school students concluded: "Our results suggest that students
attempt to use [AI] as a "crutch" during practice problem sessions,
and when successful, perform worse on their own. Thus, to maintain
long-term productivity, we must be cautious when deploying generative
AI to ensure humans continue to learn critical skills."  ([[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4895486&s=03][Bastani et
al, 2024]]).

Here are two recent accounts from coders: [[https://erikschluntz.com/software/2024/07/30/code-with-ai.html][Schluntz]] / [[https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2024/how-i-use-ai.html][Carlini]]
