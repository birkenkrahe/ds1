1. Go to your DataCamp dashboard.

2. You can get to =DataLab= from the dashboard selector but we're going
   to do something different: Open the "Introduction to R" course
   dashboard: select =Learn= and type =Introduction to R= in the search.

3. You can see that there are almost as many offerings in Python as in
   R - if you narrow it down, you can see that R has a lead on
   probability and stats, while Python leads for machine
   learning. Narrow the search to =R= and find the =Introduction to R=
   course (assigned to you later in this class).

4. In the course dashboard, find the =Create Course Notes= under
   =Resources= in the right sidebar and click on =+=.

5. You are now in the =DataLab= application. This is an interactive
   notebook like Emacs + Org-mode earlier. It's got some advanatages
   and some disadvantages. Open a =New Workbook=.

6. Though you came from an R course, these notebooks are set to Python
   by default. Change that in the =Environment= tab by selecting =R= as
   =Workbook language=, and run =Start session= to restart the
   environment.

7. In the workbook editor, you can now see that =R= instead of =Python= is
   offered, alongside =Text=, =SQL= and =Chart=. Click on =Text= and then
   repeat the commands that you used in Emacs before (almost) to the
   letter: this text is =Markdown= - headlines are started with =#=, and
   code font is obtained with =`= (backtick) rather than ===.

   [[../img/datalab_text.png]]

8. Now, instead of writing code in the text, you need to add an =R=
   block with =+=: You have the choice to add code or =tell our AI what
   to do=. Why don't we try that! At the prompt, enter
   #+begin_example
   Show me the structure of the mtcars data frame.
   #+end_example

9. This is what you get - if it's correct (as shown) then click
   =Accept=.
   #+attr_html: :width 450px:
   [[../img/datalab_ai.png]]

10. You now have a code block and you can cancel the AI prompt entry
    field and run the code by clicking on the play button (or typing
    =CTRL + RET= on the keyboard). You should get the same result as in
    Emacs.
    #+attr_html: :width 450px:
    [[../img/datalab_mtcars.png]]

11. Let's move on with the plot: put the following into a text box,
    and then repeat it at the AI prompt:
    #+begin_example
    Make a scatterplot of miles-per-gallon vs. weight
    and store the plot in a file `mtcars.png`.
    #+end_example
    #+attr_html: :width 600px:
    [[../img/datalab_plot.png]]

    Because you saved the result to a file, it won't show in the
    notebook. You need to open it using the tab =File > Show Workbook
    Files=:
    #+attr_html: :width 500px:
    [[../img/datalab_ggplot.png]]
    
    You recognize the scatterplot from Emacs though the code is vastly
    more complicated than necessary, leading to a customized plot.

12. The AI result is markedly different from what we did in Emacs
    (below). Let's see what DataLab does when we use this command:
    #+attr_html: :width 600px:
    [[../img/emacs_plot.png]]

    Add a new code block, enter the one-line command and run the
    block - you will notice that the R console suggests completions to
    you, e.g. when you type =plot(x==mtcars$=, all the possible columns
    of =mtcars= are suggested to you.
    #+attr_html: :width 500px: 
    [[../img/datalab_plot2.png]]
    
    This time, the plot is shown in the notebook itself just like in
    Emacs, which both stores the plot and shows it.

13. Before leaving, give your workbook a title: =Testing R= will be
    suggested when you click on the title field. This workbook will be
    permanent as long as you have a DataCamp account. Though if you
    aren't subscribed to my DataCamp classroom, you'll have a limited
    number of workbooks and a limited number of AI prompts available.

* Issues with interactive notebooks

There are multiple problems with this approach:
- The interface changes often
- Having AI assistance at your fingertips (which you could also add to
  Emacs) is dangerous for beginners: you learn nothing or very little,
  and the code tends to be more complicated than necessary.
- You can only use one language per notebook at a time (R or
  Python), and only interpreted languages (not C,C++, Java, etc.).
- You rely on an Internet connection
- You can save and share your notebook only in the =.ipynb= (I-Python)
  format (that's plain-text but needs notebook software to be
  processed). You can also render Emacs-Org-mode notebooks in this
  format for upload to commercial notebook tools

* Which tool to use when

When competing, you might have to use commercial tools (like Datalab,
Jupyter, VSCode, RStudio, Colab) but whenever possible you should
revert to FOSS tools (like Emacs + Org-mode). They're usually superior
by design and offer much more flexibility and productivity gains.
