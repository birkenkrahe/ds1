- For detail and many more examples on barplots, histograms, density
  plots, and their customization, see the updated (for 2024) lecture
  script =10_plots.org= in GitHub.

- This practice file is an edited version of parts of that file
  pertaining only to boxplots and scatterplots, using an earthquake
  dataset.

* Boxplots - global summary stats

- Box-and-whisker plots, or boxplots represent Tukey's five-number
  ~summary~:
  1) Minimum
  2) 1st quartile (25% of the values are below it)
  3) Median (50% of the values are below/above it)
  4) Mean (Arithmetic average)
  5) 3rd quartile (75% of the values are below it)
  6) Maximum

- For example for ~x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)~:
  #+begin_src R
    x <- 1:10
    summary(x)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  :    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  :    1.00    3.25    5.50    5.50    7.75   10.00

- We use the built-in ~quakes~ data frame of the location of 1,000
  seismic events with magnitude > 4.0 near the island of Fiji.

- Check the structure, print the top of the dataset, and compute the
  summary for the whole data frame.

  #+begin_src R
    data(quakes)
    ls()
    str(quakes)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1] "quakes" "x"
  : 'data.frame':	1000 obs. of  5 variables:
  :  $ lat     : num  -20.4 -20.6 -26 -18 -20.4 ...
  :  $ long    : num  182 181 184 182 182 ...
  :  $ depth   : int  562 650 42 626 649 195 82 194 211 622 ...
  :  $ mag     : num  4.8 4.2 5.4 4.1 4 4 4.8 4.4 4.7 4.3 ...
  :  $ stations: int  41 15 43 19 11 12 43 15 35 19 ...

- The observations include the following variables: latitude and
  longitude, depth and magnitude of the epicenter of the earthquake,
  and number of the stations that registered the event.

- Not all variables are statistically relevant for the =summary=. Pick
  the ones that are and compute their =summary=.

  #+begin_src R
    ## from the inside - data
    c("depth", "mag", "stations") -> num
    quakes[ ,num] -> data
    summary(data)
    ## from the outside - functions
    summary(quakes[,c("depth","mag","stations")])
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example

  #+end_example

- The boxplot of the earthquake magnitudes shows the output of ~summary~
  except the ~mean~, but it also shows /outliers/, extreme values that
  distort the mean. [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1/blob/main/img/9_boxplot_explained.png][Here is an illustration of the boxplot]].

- Creating a =boxplot= is simple. Do it for the earthquake magnitudes
  (~quakes$mag~):

  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file quakes_mag_box.png
    par(mfrow=c(2,1))
    hist(quakes$mag,
         xlab="",
         main="Earthquake magnitude in `quakes`")
    boxplot(quakes$mag,  # extract magnitude `mag` for boxplot
            horizontal=TRUE,
            xlab="Earthquake magnitude (Richter scale)",
            main="Boxplot"
            )
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:quakes_mag_box.png]]

- Let's look at histogram and boxplot on top of one another, and then
  do a minimal customization).

  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file quakes.png

  #+end_src

- Like the histogram, a boxplot shows important *global* (overall)
  features of the value distribution:
  + centrality (where is the midpoint of the distribution?)x
  + spread (how far are the whiskers apart, how wide is the box?)
  + skewness (where is the box relative to the whiskers?)

- The boxplot does *not* show important *local* features, like
  + modes (multiple significant peaks or maxima)
  + valleys (local minima)

- Outliers are displayed explicitly, computed as 1.5 times the
  Inter-Quartile Range or =IQR=.

- The ~range~ parameter in ~boxplot~ determines how far the whiskers
  should extend from the box. ~range=0~ includes all values.

  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file boxplot1.png
    boxplot(quakes$mag, horizontal=TRUE,
            range=1) # range=0 will suppress outlier computation
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:boxplot1.png]]

* Side-by-side boxplots

- Boxplots are useful to compare data features by plotting them
  side-by-side, e.g. for identifying how many monitoring stations
  detected each event

- We use ~cut~ to create three levels of stations for three boxes:
  #+begin_src R
    stations <- cut(quakes$stations, breaks=c(0,50,100,150))
    stations[1:5]
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1] (0,50] (0,50] (0,50] (0,50] (0,50]
  : Levels: (0,50] (50,100] (100,150]

- The factor ~stations~ breaks the observations in three groups
  1) events detected by 50 stations or fewer ~(0,50]~
  2) events detected by 51 to 100 stations ~(50,100]~
  3) events detected by between 100 and 150 stations ~(100,150]~

- The boxplot compares the distributions of the magnitudes of the
  events according to these three groups:
  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file 9_stations.png
    boxplot(quakes$mag ~ stations, xlab="stations detected")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:9_stations.png]]

- You can see that the higher the recorded magnitude, the more
  stations detected the given seismic event.

* Scatterplots

- Scatterplots are used to identify relationships between the observed
  values of two different numeric-continuous variables x,y

- The scatterplot is displayed as an x-y-coordinate plot but not every
  x-y-plot shows relationships of interest - e.g. a plot of the
  latitude vs. longitude in ~quakes~:
  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file noscatter.png
    plot(x=quakes$lat,
         y=quakes$lon)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:noscatter.png]]

* Scatterplots of more than two variables

- The famous ~iris~ dataset, collected in the mid-1930s, contains petal
  and sepal measurements for three species of perennial iris flowers,
  /Iris setosa/, /Iris virginica/, and /Iris versicolor/ (Fisher, 1936).

  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1/blob/main/img/iris.png][See image for these flowers]].

- View the first few records of the first four variables only:
  #+begin_src R

  #+end_src

- To plot every variable against every other, you can plot an array of
  x-y-plots:
  + Each column has the shown variable as x- and the others as y-axis
  + Each row has the shown variable as y- and the others as x-axis
  + E.g. the square (2,1) shows x = ~Sepal.Length~, y = all others
  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file iris.png

  #+end_src

- What can you say about the =Species= variable?
  #+begin_quote

  #+end_quote

  #+begin_src R

  #+end_src

- The array is much easier to read when adding the iris species as a
  sixth variable to the plot.
  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file 9_iris_col.png
    
  #+end_src

- Homing in on one of the diagrams, e.g. ~Sepal.Width~ vs. ~Sepal.Length~:
  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file 9_iris1.png

  #+end_src

 - As an example for a fully customized plot with legend:
  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file ../img/9_iris_final.png
    plot(
      y=iris$Petal.Length, xlab="Petal length (cm)",
      x=iris$Petal.Width, ylab="Petal width (cm)",
      col=iris$Species,
      pch=19)
    legend("topleft",
           legend=c("setosa", "virginica","versicolor"),
           col=c("black","red","green"), pch=19)
    title("Petal width vs. length for three species of iris")
  #+end_src

- This dataset is also one example for an [[https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/start-simple/kmeans-example/][R Shiny dashboard]] that we've
  been discussing in the "data visualization" class.
