This is a demo notebook using R and the R shell (R Core Team, 2022) as
part of an DataCamp workspace demo originally developed by DataCamp
for Python (Schouwenaars & Cotton, 2022). Along the way, we'll also
test the "AI" and the shared editing functions. We use the "unicorns"
dataset (CB Insights, 2023) to demonstrate the following data
analytics steps:

1. Importing a CSV file as a ~data.frame~
2. Viewing ~unique~ column data
3. Cleaning a data frame column
4. Grouping data by column values
5. Creating a barplot of category counts

** Unicorn Companies

A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)][unicorn company]] is a privately held startup company with a current
valuation of over $1 billion USD. In this workspace, we'll be looking
at a dataset that consists of unicorn companies and startups across
the globe as of November 2021, including country of origin, sector,
select investors, and valuation of each unicorn. Former unicorn
companies that have since exited due to IPO (Initial Public Offering)
or acquisitions are not included in this list.

** Importing a CSV file as data frame

We import the CSV file as a data frame and print the column headers
(alongside other information) with the ~str~ function. If you only want
the headers as a vector, use ~colnames~ instead:

#+begin_src R
  df = read.csv('../data/unicorn_companies.csv')
  str(df)
  colnames(df)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 'data.frame':	917 obs. of  6 variables:
:  $ Company         : chr  "Bytedance" "SpaceX" "Stripe" "Klarna" ...
:  $ Valuation...B.  : chr  "$140.00" "$100.30" "$95.00" "$45.60" ...
:  $ Date.Added      : chr  "4/7/17" "12/1/12" "1/23/14" "12/12/11" ...
:  $ Country         : chr  "China" "United States" "United States" "Sweden" ...
:  $ Category        : chr  "Artificial intelligence" "Other" "Fintech" "Fintech" ...
:  $ Select.Investors: chr  "Sequoia Capital China, SIG Asia Investments, Sina Weibo, Softbank Group" "Founders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Rothenberg Ventures" "Khosla Ventures, LowercaseCapital, capitalG" "Institutional Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, General Atlantic" ...
: [1] "Company"          "Valuation...B."   "Date.Added"      
: [4] "Country"          "Category"         "Select.Investors"

You can also print the data frame directly. When you run this cell,
either with the mouse or by entering CTRL-ENTER, the first 10 records
of the DataFrame ~df~ and the headline with the features are shown. At
the bottom of the output you see an option to create a ~Chart~ - better
wait with that until you understand the data set better.

#+begin_src R :results none
  df
#+end_src

Though the data look quite clean and appealing, a table view is not
the best way to get an overview - there are too many records.

** Viewing ~unique~ column data

For investment purposes, the ~Category~ column or feature is most
interesting: this is the type of company. How many of these types
are there?

To print out all unique categories, we can use the ~unique~
function, which will return all unique entries in the ~Category~
column if we index the data frame accordingly.
#+begin_src R
  unique(df$Category) # df['Category'] or df[,5] also work
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
 [1] "Artificial intelligence"            
 [2] "Other"                              
 [3] "Fintech"                            
 [4] "Internet software & services"       
 [5] "Supply chain, logistics, & delivery"
 [6] "Data management & analytics"        
 [7] "Edtech"                             
 [8] "E-commerce & direct-to-consumer"    
 [9] "Hardware"                           
[10] "Auto & transportation"              
[11] "Health"                             
[12] "Consumer & retail"                  
[13] "Finttech"                           
[14] "Travel"                             
[15] "Cybersecurity"                      
[16] "Mobile & telecommunications"        
[17] "Artificial Intelligence"
#+end_example

You can see that there are duplicates because of typos
(~Finttech~) and capitalization (~Artificial Intelligence~). Let's
remove the ambiguities.

To get help, you can use ~?~ or the ~help~ function:
#+begin_example python
  ?unique
  help(unique)
#+end_example

There is a lot of help information here and you may want to look at it
on the web instead e.g. using [[https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html][this function index for base R]].

** Testing the AI coding assistant

This is a good place to show off your ~AI~ assistant: you may not know
how to look for help for ~unique~. Add an ~AI~ code block. The assistant
will ask you for a prompt. For simple questions like these, almost any
prompt will do, e.g. ~I need help for the function `unique`.~ The marks
around ~unique~ will help the computer understand that you mean a
command (these marks are also used for coding font markdown in text
blocks).

The AI returns the whole documentation but We only want a short
explanation that an absolute beginner can understand. Let's ask for
that directly:
#+begin_quote
As an absolute beginner in R, I need a very short explanation
of what `unique` does and how I can use it on a column of a data
frame.
#+end_quote

The answer is good and short:
#+begin_quote
# The `unique` function in R returns the unique values in a vector or
# column of a data frame.  To use `unique` on a column of a data
# frame, you can specify the column name using the `$` operator.  For
# example, to get the unique values in the "Company" column of the
# `df` data frame:
unique(df$Company)
#+end_quote

To test the AI yet again, remove the last parenthesis after the
function call to ~unique~: ~unique(df$Category~. This yields an error. At
the bottom of the output, you can click on ~Fix & explain~. The
explanation is good.

Let's try to trip the AI up. Replacing ~$~ by ~%~ does not work. The error
is correctly identified and fixed. But if we try to run
~unique(df[Category])~, the AI suggests the ~$~ operator once again and
does not identify the quickest (or the alternative) solution,
~unique(df['Category']~.

These experiments show that we're still quite far away from getting
fully relieved of our coding burdens but for simple fixes, it's pretty
good.

** Clean data frame column ~Category~

There are a couple of typos in the ~Category~ values: 'Artificial
intelligence' needs to become 'Artificial Intelligence', and
'Finttech' needs to become 'Fintech' everywhere in the dataframe.

You can do this with ~gsub~, which matches the first argument
and replaces it by the second everywhere in the column:
#+begin_src R
  ## Correct typos in the 'Category' column
  df$Category <- gsub("Artificial intelligence", "Artificial Intelligence", df$Category)
  df$Category <- gsub("Finttech", "Fintech", df$Category)

  ## Display the first few rows to verify the changes
  unique(df$Category)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
 [1] "Artificial Intelligence"            
 [2] "Other"                              
 [3] "Fintech"                            
 [4] "Internet software & services"       
 [5] "Supply chain, logistics, & delivery"
 [6] "Data management & analytics"        
 [7] "Edtech"                             
 [8] "E-commerce & direct-to-consumer"    
 [9] "Hardware"                           
[10] "Auto & transportation"              
[11] "Health"                             
[12] "Consumer & retail"                  
[13] "Travel"                             
[14] "Cybersecurity"                      
[15] "Mobile & telecommunications"
#+end_example

** Share editing rights

One of the neater properties of DataCamp Workspace is the ability to
share your notebook and edit synchronously like in GoogleDocs.

Click on the sharing sign at the top and share *editing* access
with your neighbor by using his/her email. Also, reduce "General
access" to "Disable access" - now nobody except those you invite via
email can see your file.

You have to use the person's email used for DataCamp - make sure
it's their Lyon College email. Once they've been invited, you can
let them access to edit, view, comment or remove their access.

Print the cleaned dataframe ~df~ in each other's notebooks by
adding a new code block with the command ~df~ and run it.

Once this is done, ~Remove~ access from your workspace for the
other person.

** Grouping data by column values

Now that the categories are cleaned up, we group by ~Category~. In R, we
can do this with the ~dplyr~ package, or with ~data.table~, or with base
R.

*** Grouping data by column with base R

With base R, we can use the ~stats::aggregate~ function, which splits
the data into subsets.
#+begin_src R
  ## Group by 'Category' and get the count in each category
  grouped_df <- aggregate(Company ~ Category, data=df1, FUN=length)
  colnames(grouped_df)[2] <- "Count"

  ## Display the grouped data
  grouped_df
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Error in eval(m$data, parent.frame()) : object 'df1' not found
: Error in colnames(grouped_df)[2] <- "Count" : 
:   object 'grouped_df' not found
: Error: object 'grouped_df' not found

The function ~order~ returns a permutation that rearranges
its first argument into ascending (default) or descending order:
#+begin_src R
  ## Sort grouped_df by 'Count' in ascending order:
  grouped_df <- grouped_df[order(grouped_df$Count),]
  grouped_df
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Error: object 'grouped_df' not found
: Error: object 'grouped_df' not found

*** Grouping data by column with ~dplyr~


** Creating a barplot of category counts

Plotting is a cinch in R: the ~barplot~ function will create a simple
bar plot of ~grouped_df~ right away:
#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file ../img/workspace_barplot.png
  barplot(grouped_df$Count ~ sort(grouped_df$Category),
          ylab = "Frequency", xlab = "",
          main = "Unicorn company distribution across industries",
          las = 2)
#+end_src

#+Results:
[[file:../img/workspace_barplot.png]]

Here is a more customized plot:
#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file ../img/workspace_barplot_customized.png
  ## Order the rows in descending order based on 'Count'
  grouped_df <- grouped_df[order(grouped_df$Count), ]

  ## Use a nice color palette
  library(RColorBrewer)
  colors <- brewer.pal(length(grouped_df$Category), "Pastel1")

  ## Set up the plot parameters
  par(mar=c(10, 5, 4, 2) + 0.1,
      las=2,
      mgp=c(3, 1, 0),
      tcl=-0.3)

  ## Create the barplot
  barplot(
    grouped_df$Count,
    names.arg=grouped_df$Category,
    col=colors,
    main="Counts by Company Category",
    ylab="Count",
    border="white",
    cex.names=0.8)

  ## Add grid lines
  abline(h=seq(0, max(grouped_df$Count), by=5),
         col="gray", lty="dotted")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:../img/workspace_barplot_customized.png]]
